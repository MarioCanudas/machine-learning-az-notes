# Machine Learning A-Z: Course personal notes and scripts

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Objective

This repository serves as a dedicated space to store and organize all the **code implementations**, **exercises**, and **projects** developed while following the **"Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science"** course by the SuperDataScience Team.

The primary goals of this repository are:

* **Personal Reference:** To create a comprehensive collection of well-documented machine learning algorithms and concepts for future reference and review.
* **Progress Tracking:** To showcase my learning journey and practical application of various machine learning models, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** To provide a clear and accessible resource for anyone interested in seeing practical implementations of the techniques taught in the SuperDataScience Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢ course.

Feel free to explore the different folders, each corresponding to a specific section or topic covered in the course. Each script is designed to be self-contained and demonstrates the practical application of the concepts learned.
